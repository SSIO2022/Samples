-- The only manual intervention required by the administrator is to grant the 
-- availability group object permissions to create databases on the secondary 
-- replicas. This is slightly different from a typical GRANT statement for permissions:
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG_WWI] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;

-- After automatic seeding, the AUTHORIZATION (also known as owner) of the database 
-- on the secondary replica might be different from the AUTHORIZATION of the 
-- database on the primary. You should check to ensure that they are the same, 
-- and alter the database if needed:
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::WideWorldImporters TO [serverprincipal];
--Stop automatic seeding
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG_WWI] --availability group name
   MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SQLSERVER-1\SQL2022' --Replica name
   WITH (SEEDING_MODE = MANUAL); --'Join Only' in SSMS
GO

ORDER BY [start_time] desc;

-- If automatic seeding fails, remember to drop the unsuccessfully seeded 
-- database on the secondary replica, including the database data and log 
-- files in the file path. After you have resolved the errors and want to 
-- retry automatic seeding, you can do so by using the following example 
-- T-SQL statement. 
-- Run this code sample on the primary replica to retry automatic seeding:
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG_WWI] --availability group name
    MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SQLSERVER-1\SQL2022' --Replica name
    WITH (SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC); --Automatic Seeding
