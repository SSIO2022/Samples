--Restores to SQL managed instance are asynchronous. Should your connection to your SQL managed instance be lost, the RESTORE continues. You can check the status of the operations with sys.dm_operation_status. Replace "mydb" with your database name in the following T-SQL script:
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_operation_status
             WHERE major_resource_id = 'mydb'
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
